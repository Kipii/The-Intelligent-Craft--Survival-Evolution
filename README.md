# The-Intelligent-Craft--Survival-Evolution
Uni Project

In this game the player can collect items, sleep to restore health, encounter random events, loot items, craft tools, and gain experience points.

The items that can be collected include plant fibres, wood, and stone, as well as special items like fuel and wires. Sleeping in the game causes the day to change and restores 20% of the player's health.

The game also includes random events, such as a 5% chance of breaking your leg, causing 5hp damage, or a 3% chance of being bitten by a wolf, causing 15hp damage. If the player has a sword when encountering a wolf, they will receive a message saying that they were able to defend themselves. If the player's health falls to zero, they will receive a message saying that they died.

The game includes a looting event where the player can find a spacex lab with two rooms. The first room contains wires and fuel, while the second room contains a spaceship that can be activated if the player has enough wires and fuel to fix it (500 fuel and 10 wires).

To craft items, the player needs to follow specific recipes, such as 1 wood, 3 plant fibre, 2 stone, and 2 intelligence skill to craft an axe. Crafting items grants experience points with that item, and the player can only craft one sword, which reduces the damage taken from wolves.

Finally, the game includes a skill called "study" that gives the player 1 xp of intelligence.
